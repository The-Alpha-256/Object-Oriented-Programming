This is a simple object-oriented Python project that models a car rental system with vehicles like cars and trucks, and a garage that can hold them. The project demonstrates inheritance, encapsulation, and basic Python class usage.

Project Structure
The project includes the following Python files:

Vehicle.py: Defines the base Vehicle class with a color attribute.
Car.py: Inherits from Vehicle and adds a winter_tires attribute.
Truck.py: Inherits from Vehicle and adds a trailer attribute.
Garage.py: A garage class that can hold any vehicle (Car, Truck, or any other Vehicle).
GarageTester.py: A test class to demonstrate the functionality of parking a truck in the garage.
